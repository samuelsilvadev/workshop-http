> Project to save evolution from a server created from scratch using only `net` package from NODE.

## How to install

```ssh
    npm i
```

## How to run the server

```ssh
    npm start
```

## How to test the server

One way would be using `telnet` directly. <br>
Just open your bash terminal and type the following:

```ssh
    telnet 127.0.0.1:8080
```

After that you will enter in the command line interface from telnet, then you can type commands that will be interpreted already by our server.

eg:

```ssh
    GET / HTTP/1.1
    connection: keep-alive
```

after finish type, to get some response, double click the enter on your keyboard. For now we just have the `/` and `/async` route enabled.
